# UniDocSystem
My BE Final Year Project


The UniDoc System provides a means to the Residents of the country to identify themselves in various Governmental and Non govermental Departments. The system will create central repository of residents which includes POA and POI with biometrics and it will further form a structure like a profile which includes documents like birth and death certificate, educational details, results, driving license, election card and so on. The system will provide a unique enrollment number to every residents through which every profile will be linked according to their relationships. The UniDoc system will provide e-kyc services to various govermental departments. It provides and an easy and efficient way to update and synchronize their data. It helps to increase consistency and reduce redundancy of data or documents among various governmental departments which results in reduced administrative overhead, time money and paper saving.
